The coordinator should notice if a worker hasn't completed its task in a reasonable amount of time 
(for this lab, use ten seconds), and give the same task to a different worker.

The worker should put intermediate Map output in files in the current directory, 
where your worker can later read them as input to Reduce tasks.

Depending on your design, 
you might also find it helpful to have a "please exit" pseudo-task that the coordinator can give to workers.

A reasonable naming convention for intermediate files is mr-X-Y, 
where X is the Map task number, and Y is the reduce task number.
